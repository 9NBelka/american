This is not a guru course trying to tell you about everything, but instead contains a set of approaches and practices suitable for projects of any scale. The project in the course specifically does not use third-party libraries in order to give a detailed understanding of all parts of the project (DI, entry point, etc.).",

      "Game development teaches you to solve not only immediate programming problems, but rather problems of the product as a whole. Therefore, we consider both the product code and the setup of its environment."
